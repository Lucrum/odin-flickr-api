# odin-flickr-api

This project is from The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flickr-api).

A small, Ruby on Rails based application that takes in a user's Flickr user ID and displays their public photos.

Communicates with Flickr's API through the [Flickr](https://github.com/cyclotron3k/flickr) gem and stores keys/secrets with [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro).
